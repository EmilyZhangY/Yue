                <hr>
                <p>To improve the quality of sleeping, we designed a interactive night lamp. People can not only play with it before going to bed, but also can comfort by its violet light. lavendern aroma, white noise sound and warm temperature. We hope that it will allow the people who seek peaceful nights to regain sweet dreams.</p>
                <h1>PROBLEMS DISCOVERY</h1>
                <img src="images/lavender/lavender1.png" alt="Image">
                <h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
                <p>At that time, one of my roommates had been under a lot of stress in her relationship, so that her sleep is bad. A slight noise will make her awake, and last long insomnia made she feel terrible. After doing some research, I realized that modern people had various sleep problems in recent years. 
                So we decided to make an installation that can help people to regain good sleep. Take the meaning of lavender and lantern, we named it Lavendern. The fragrant essential oil for sleep, as well as the peaceful lavender light will bring people fairytale nights and sweet dreams.</p>
                <h1>CONCEPT</h1>
                <img src="images/lavender/lavender2.png" alt="Image">
                <p>To hold the Lavendern lamp, the user's action motion triggers a series interaction with devices.By combining the soft light,white noises sound, lavander aroma, warm temperature and other healing elements together, we want to make users relax from sight, smell, hearing and touch, so as to achieve a better cure effect.</p>

                <h2>About Lavender</h2>
                <p>There was a study about to compare the effectiveness of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and sleep hygiene versus sleep hygiene alone on sleep quantity and sleep quality and to determine sustained effect at two-week follow-up.<br/>
                A randomized controlled trial with investigator blinding and steps taken to blind the participants. The setting was the participants usual sleep setting. Seventy-nine college students with self-reported sleep issues (difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, or daytime sleepiness). <br/>
                As a result, lavender and sleep hygiene together, and sleep hygiene alone to a lesser degree, improved sleep quality for college students with self-reported sleep issues, with an effect remaining at follow-up.<br/> 
                So, if we want to improve our sleep quality, we should practice good sleep hygiene, and lavender is also helpful. <br/>

                <h6 class="desc">AUG. 2017 -- OCT. 2017 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>
                <hr>
                <p>Most children are curious and want to explore the limitations of the past and the future of the world. There's a problem. Only through Museum documentaries, pictures, drawings, earth science knowledge, children are difficult to understand. Fragmentation of knowledge allows children to accept the information disorder.</p>
                <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
                <h2>World Science Education Development Map</h2>
                <img src="images/bignews/1.png" alt="Image">
                <p>In 2016, some experiments were conducted to collect relevant data about children's science education in china. The results show that the main purpose of science education for children in China is to cultivate scientific inquiry ability and satisfy children's curiosity. The main ways of education are explanation, demonstration and practice by children themselves.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/2.png" alt="Image">
                <p>In 2011, Professor Kou Yuxia conducted an experiment on science enlightenment education in six kindergartens directly under the Heilongjiang province of china. The results show that preschool teachers have a lower mastery of scientific knowledge. At the same time, teachers have a correct understanding of the purpose of science education in kindergartens.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/3.png" alt="Image">
                <p>However, preschool teachers are deficient in the methods of imparting scientific knowledge. Only some preschool teachers can design different teaching methods and different game content to instill knowledge. Most preschool teachers are relatively single in their teaching methods. For example, from the material situation, the material form is small, and some of the materials are unsafe and difficult to operate, such as: glass, iron nails, iron filings, etc.</p>

                <h2>Existing Science Education Products and Ways</h2>
                <img src="images/bignews/5.png" alt="Image">
                <h1>EXPERIMENT</h1>
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <p>Each group had 30 minutes to play mobile phone app, read science books, or listen to teacher’s lecture to get science knowledge. After 30 minutes, they all need to answer a quick test, so that we can know the extent to which they acquire knowledge through different methods.</p>
                <h3>Population</h3>
                <p>There were 30 fourth grade students at Beijing Zhongguancun No.1 Primary School participated this experiment. Students’ ages are from 9 to 11. 30 students were divided into 3 groups, and each group include 10 students.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/6.png" alt="Image">
                <p>From the three educational methods designed ten topics, considering the experimental students aged 9-11 years old, do not want to cause too much burden on the answer, so students only choose right and wrong.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/7.png" alt="Image">
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <img src="images/bignews/8.png" alt="Image">
                <p>In group A, 1 students stopped using app in eighteenth minutes. All 6 students stopped using -25 for 20 minutes. Only 3 students play app all the time. 10 students scored an average of 8.1 points.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/9.png" alt="Image">
                <p>In group B, 3 students did not read books in 10 minutes. 2 students stopped reading in 10-15 minutes. The remaining 5 students stopped reading in 15-20 minutes. 10 students scored an average of 5.8 points.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/10.png" alt="Image">
                <p>In group C, from the tenth minute, and 2 students were not listening. 15-20 minutes, half of the students are not listening. In twenty-fifth minutes, only 1 students attended the lecture. 10 students scored an average of 6.3 points.</p>
                <img src="images/bignews/11.png" alt="Image">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Students' attention time is significantly longer for interactive app. In the process of playing app, the amount of knowledge is relatively large. Pure text and pictures of book forms, students receive information is low, and no interest. Classroom instruction, although it allows students to obtain basic information, but no initiative in learning.</p>
                <h1>DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h1>
                <p>This project focuses on the development of the earth, and products can provide visual and interesting knowledge experience for teenagers. You can also take it with you and share it with your friends.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>BABiES is a intelligent nursery system for babies and parents, including hardware facilities and software support. We hope that this system can give nursery room in China a new possible solution, and solve real problems in the parenting process as well.</p>
                <p>I played the role of the leader, UX designer in the team.</p>
                <h1>IMPORTANCE</h1>
                <p>Many young mothers have felt embarrass when breast-feed in public, so some mothers bring bottles, or simply just limit breastfeeding space. They prefer not to go outside or even never go outside, even if they have to go outside ,just go out in a hurry. Many mothers feel helpless for the the lack of parent rooms.</p>
                <img src="images/babies/babies1.png" alt="Image">
                <p>Parent room is not simply a room with a bed, but a room meeting diverse needs of mothers, supporting perfect basic infrastructure and guaranteed service. At the same time ,develop management system, clear responsibilities, improve service, avoid to be a white elephant, so that mothers have the dignity, safety and reassurance to exercise their mothers' rights.</p>
                <h1>PROBLEMS IN CHINA</h1>
                <p>The institution Babytree in China has made an investigation of one hundred and fifty thousand family  about the parent room, the result shows that only 11.3% of the company provides nursery rooms for mothers. And the higher level the city is, the better situation it gets.</p>
                <p>At present, not private and incomplete internal hardware facilities become the main  problems of most parent rooms in China. Also, the majority of parent rooms are poor in sanitary conditions ,not comfortable, even everybody can enter, and the area is too small. </p>
                <p>The survey also collected the needs of mothers for the location of the nursery. 63.5% mothers were most expected to set up public parent rooms in the mall, Then the park and the street with 54.9%  and 39.6% .</p>
                <img src="images/babies/babies2.png" alt="Image">
                <p>As a result, there is still a lot of room for development and improvement of parent room inChina , and there is a growing demand of it. So I chose this theme, and want to offer a possible solution to improve this situation.</p>
                <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
                <p>These were three shopping malls I chose, which are the center of children shopping as well as having nursery rooms. I found some reviews about the nursery rooms on the internet. And then I sorted out the data.</p>

                <h1>QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY</h1>
                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>We made a questionnaire in order to know basic needs of ordinary people when they look at paintings in gallery. </p>
                <p>The first question of is: Have you ever been to art gallery to see paintings? Only when the answer is “yes”, this questionnaire will be valid.</p>
                <h2>Date</h2>
                <p>2016-7-17 Sunday  14:00-16:00 </p>
                <h2>Location</h2>
                <img src="images/finalpiece/5.png" alt="Image">
                <h2>Data Analyze</h2>
                <p>On that day, 47 samples were collected out of 50 with effective return-ratio 92.0% in 2 hours.<br/>
                It showed that only 4 people had never been to gallery to see pictures. The most common used services in gallery are introduction next to the exhibits, manual tour guide and brochures. Only two of them understood every painting. One person did not understand paintings completely. There are 42 people who want to know about the artist's background and 39 people who want to experience the scenes.</p>
                <img src="images/finalpiece/6.png" alt="Image">
                <h1>USER REQUAIREMENT</h1>
                <p>1.Have less people in gallery, so that user can concentrate on the paintings I like.</p>
                <p>2.User want to buy souvenirs so that the memory of visiting the gallery can be saved.</p>
                <p>3.Feel the emotion that the artist have, so that user can understand the paintings deeply.</p>
                <p>4.Have a comfortable environment so that user can have passion to explore.</p>
                <p>And these are the reasons that I chose VR to develop this project.</p>
                <h1>DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h1>
                <p>It’s always a tough task for me - a curious person without professional art knowledge - to understand paintings, especially in a museum or a gallery. White space, quiet environment and far distance, they all make me feel far away from artworks.</p>
                <p>So I was thinking, why can’t we experience the artist’s pieces as well his emotion directly, so that we can immerse and understand more.</p>
                <p>The project was designed to allow people understanding more about the famous masters’ painting through VR interaction. We chose Van Gogh’s last painting in life ——“Wheatfield with Crows”as an example, reverted  the painting”Van Gogh's bedroom” to VR scene, added another room and some items .The background period is 1889 - 1990 when Van Gogh’s reached the peak so that users can be immersive, as if burst into the painter's life, get a glimpse of his emotion, at the same time  pay tribute to the great painters like Van Gogh and so on.</p>

                <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
                <h2>Art</h2>
                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>
                <p>During the art process, we read the biographical novel "yearn for life”, searched for information about Van Gogh, and reverted the story into the art scheme.  After that, we designed the furniture and decoration of the painting room and bedroom, chose artistic style of retro and colorful and drew the scenes, room arrangement and texture.<br>

                <h2>3D Modeling </h2>
                <h3>Time: 5 Days</h3>
                <p>In this VR project, every element needed to be 3d model. During that two weeks, I learned how to calculate dimensions of all the furniture and articles, use maya to make models and drew the rendering of the model texture. Some of these models need to be separated into different parts, so that user can interact with and play around.<br>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <h3>Time: 4 Days</h3>
                <p>We hadn’t learned how to write codes for VR projects before, so we searched the open source code using Javascript, studied and restructured it with the help of teacher. At the same time, we imported 3d model into Unity, added animation and collider and so on. After 3 nights that stay up late, we completed the programming part. Also, we finished the opening cinematic with Animation in Maya.<br>

                <h2>User Test</h2>
                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>
                <p>At the end of the project, we invited some teachers and students in CDM to do some user tests. In the process, we told them what they need to accomplish and observed their behavior. Then we asked some prepared relevant questions to them. According to their feedback, we improved interactive logic and enriched some details, including opening cinematic and the story line.<br>

                <p>This is my final project of the European and American Children Picture Books class in the exchanging semester in Taiwan. The picture book is about a real whale sings at 52 Hz and doesn’t have herd in many years. I want to rearrange this story to convey a positive attitude towards life to children. That is ‘no matter how unique you are, you are not alone and you are gonna find your own happiness.’ And in this book, I used the visual language that provided in the book Picture This.</p>

                <p>At that period, one of our roommates had conflicts with the rest of us, and the situation was getting worse. I was wondering what she was thinking, and decied to make this horror game based on a lot of real story in our life. I set different endings including a nice and warm one, hoping that the peaceful choices will resolve those quarrel. I played the role of leader, scriptwriter and designer in the team. I used RPG Maker to develop this game.</p>
