The results show that the main purpose of science education for children in China is to cultivate scientific inquiry ability and satisfy children\'s curiosity. The main ways of education are explanation, demonstration and practice by children themselves.</p>\n                <img src="images/bignews/2.png" alt="Test Image">\n                <p>In 2011, Professor Kou Yuxia conducted an experiment on science enlightenment education in six kindergartens directly under the Heilongjiang province of china. The results show that preschool teachers have a lower mastery of scientific knowledge. At the same time, teachers have a correct understanding of the purpose of science education in kindergartens.</p>\n                <img src="images/bignews/3.png" alt="Test Image">\n                <p>However, preschool teachers are deficient in the methods of imparting scientific knowledge. Only some preschool teachers can design different teaching methods and different game content to instill knowledge. Most preschool teachers are relatively single in their teaching methods. For example, from the material situation, the material form is small, and some of the materials are unsafe and difficult to operate, such as: glass, iron nails, iron filings, etc.</p>\n                <h1>RELATED PRODUCTS</h1>\n                <img src="images/bignews/4.png" alt="Test Image">\n                <h2>Existing Science Education Products and Ways</h2>\n                <img src="images/bignews/5.png" alt="Test Image">\n                <h1>EXPERIMENT</h1>\n                <h3>Method</h3>\n                <p>Each group had 30 minutes to play mobile phone app, read science books, or listen to teacher’s lecture to get science knowledge.
