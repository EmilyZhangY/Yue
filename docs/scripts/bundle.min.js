Only some preschool teachers can design different teaching methods and different game content to instill knowledge. Most preschool teachers are relatively single in their teaching methods. For example, from the material situation, the material form is small, and some of the materials are unsafe and difficult to operate, such as: glass, iron nails, iron filings, etc.</p>\n                <h1>RELATED PRODUCTS</h1>\n                <img src="images/bignews/4.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>Existing Science Education Products and Ways</h2>\n                <img src="images/bignews/5.png" alt="Image">\n                <h1>EXPERIMENT</h1>\n                <h3>Method</h3>\n                <p>Each group had 30 minutes to play mobile phone app, read science books, or listen to teacher’s lecture to get science knowledge.

After that, we designed the furniture and decoration of the painting room and bedroom, chose artistic style of retro and colorful and drew the scenes, room arrangement and texture.<br> \n                <em>Software: Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/8.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>3D Modeling </h2>\n                <h3>Time: 5 Days</h3>\n                <p>In this VR project, every element needed to be 3d model. During that two weeks, I learned how to calculate dimensions of all the furniture and articles, use maya to make models and drew the rendering of the model texture. Some of these models need to be separated into different parts, so that user can interact with and play around.<br> \n                <em>Software: Autodesk Maya 2016, Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/9.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>Programming</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 4 Days</h3>\n                <p>We hadn’t learned how to write codes for VR projects before, so we searched the open source code using Javascript, studied and restructured it with the help of teacher. At the same time, we imported 3d model into Unity, added animation and collider and so on. After 3 nights that stay up late, we completed the programming part. Also, we finished the opening cinematic with Animation in Maya.<br>\n                <em>Software: Unity, Steam VR, Autodesk Maya 2016</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/10.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>User Test</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>At the end of the project, we invited some teachers and students in CDM to do some user tests. In the process, we told them what they need to accomplish and observed their behavior. Then we asked some prepared relevant questions to them. According to their feedback, we improved interactive logic and enriched some details, including opening cinematic and the story line.<br>\n                <em>Software: Steam VR</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/11.png" alt="Image">\n                <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>\n                <div class="video-wrap">\n                    <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ekUyxxpBt0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>Loading...</iframe>\n                </div>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/12.png" alt="Image">\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/13.png" alt="Image">\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/14.png" alt="Image">\n                '.trim();break;case 5:i='\n                <div class="content">\n                    <img id="close_sub_page" class="close-sub-page" src="images/close-btn.png" alt="Close">\n                    <h1 class="title">PROJRECT 5</h1>\n                    <h6 class="desc">JULY 2016 -- AUGUST 2016 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                    <hr>\n                    <h1>TITLE 1</h1>\n                    <h2>Title 2</h2>\n                    <h3>Title 3</h3>\n                    <p>texte xttextt exte xttextte xtextte xttexte xttex ttexte xttextt extextte xttex text text</p>\n                    <img src="images/test-img.jpg" alt="Test Image">\n                    <div class="video-wrap">\n                        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ekUyxxpBt0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>Loading...</iframe>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                '.trim();break;default:i="No Project Content!"}g.find(".content").html(i),!g.hasClass("show")&&g.addClass("show"),e("body").css({height:s+"px",overflow:"hidden"})})}(jQuery,window);
