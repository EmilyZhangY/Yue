The results show that preschool teachers have a lower mastery of scientific knowledge.

Only some preschool teachers can design different teaching methods and different game content to instill knowledge. Most preschool teachers are relatively single in their teaching methods. For example, from the material situation, the material form is small, and some of the materials are unsafe and difficult to operate, such as: glass, iron nails, iron filings, etc.</p>\n                <h1>RELATED PRODUCTS</h1>\n                <img src="images/bignews/4.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>Existing Science Education Products and Ways</h2>\n                <img src="images/bignews/5.png" alt="Image">\n                <h1>EXPERIMENT</h1>\n                <h3>Method</h3>\n                <p>Each group had 30 minutes to play mobile phone app, read science books, or listen to teacher’s lecture to get science knowledge.

White space, quiet environment and far distance, they all make me feel far away from artworks.</p>\n                <p>So I was thinking, why can’t we experience the artist’s pieces as well his emotion directly, so that we can immerse and understand more.</p>\n                <p>The project was designed to allow people understanding more about the famous masters’ painting through VR interaction. We chose Van Gogh’s last painting in life ——“Wheatfield with Crows”as an example, reverted  the painting”Van Gogh\'s bedroom” to VR scene, added another room and some items .The background period is 1889 - 1990 when Van Gogh’s reached the peak so that users can be immersive, as if burst into the painter\'s life, get a glimpse of his emotion, at the same time  pay tribute to the great painters like Van Gogh and so on.</p>\n                <h1>TOPIC &amp; BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h1>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/7.png" alt="Image">\n                <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>\n                <h2>Art</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>During the art process, we read the biographical novel "yearn for life”, searched for information about Van Gogh, and reverted the story into the art scheme.  After that, we designed the furniture and decoration of the painting room and bedroom, chose artistic style of retro and colorful and drew the scenes, room arrangement and texture.<br> \n                <em>Software: Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/8.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>3D Modeling </h2>\n                <h3>Time: 5 Days</h3>\n                <p>In this VR project, every element needed to be 3d model. During that two weeks, I learned how to calculate dimensions of all the furniture and articles, use maya to make models and drew the rendering of the model texture. Some of these models need to be separated into different parts, so that user can interact with and play around.<br> \n                <em>Software: Autodesk Maya 2016, Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/9.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>Programming</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 4 Days</h3>\n                <p>We hadn’t learned how to write codes for VR projects before, so we searched the open source code using Javascript, studied and restructured it with the help of teacher. At the same time, we imported 3d model into Unity, added animation and collider and so on. After 3 nights that stay up late, we completed the programming part. Also, we finished the opening cinematic with Animation in Maya.<br>\n                <em>Software: Unity, Steam VR, Autodesk Maya 2016</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/10.png" alt="Image">\n                <h2>User Test</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>At the end of the project, we invited some teachers and students in CDM to do some user tests. In the process, we told them what they need to accomplish and observed their behavior. Then we asked some prepared relevant questions to them. According to their feedback, we improved interactive logic and enriched some details, including opening cinematic and the story line.<br>\n                <em>Software: Steam VR</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/11.png" alt="Image">\n                <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>\n                <div class="video-wrap">\n                    <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0CyFXlAPnI" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/12.png" alt="Image">\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/13.png" alt="Image">\n                <img src="images/finalpiece/14.png" alt="Image">\n                '.trim();break;case 5:i='\n                    <h1 class="title">PROJRECT 5</h1>\n                    <h6 class="desc">JULY 2016 -- AUGUST 2016 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                    <hr>\n                    <h1>TITLE 1</h1>\n                    <h2>Title 2</h2>\n                    <h3>Title 3</h3>\n                    <p>texte xttextt exte xttextte xtextte xttexte xttex ttexte xttextt extextte xttex text text</p>\n                    <img src="images/test-img.jpg" alt="Test Image">\n                    <div class="video-wrap">\n                        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ekUyxxpBt0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>Loading...</iframe>\n                    </div>\n                '.trim();break;default:i="No Project Content!"}n(i)}),e("#games_show").on("click",".game",function(a){var t=e(a.currentTarget),s=t.data("no"),i="";switch(s){case 1:i='\n                <h1 class="title">Harmonic on the Ocean</h1>\n                <h6 class="desc">DEC. 2016 -- JAN. 2017 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                <hr>\n                <p>This is my final project of the European and American Children Picture Books class in the exchanging semester in Taiwan.
