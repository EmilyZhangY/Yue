Only some preschool teachers can design different teaching methods and different game content to instill knowledge. Most preschool teachers are relatively single in their teaching methods. For example, from the material situation, the material form is small, and some of the materials are unsafe and difficult to operate, such as: glass, iron nails, iron filings, etc.</p>\n                <h1>RELATED PRODUCTS</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/bignews/4.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h2>Existing Science Education Products and Ways</h2>\n                <img src=\"images/bignews/5.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>EXPERIMENT</h1>\n                <h3>Method</h3>\n                <p>Each group had 30 minutes to play mobile phone app, read science books, or listen to teacher’s lecture to get science knowledge.

They prefer not to go outside or even never go outside, even if they have to go outside ,just go out in a hurry. Many mothers feel helpless for the the lack of parent rooms.</p>\n                <img src=\"images/babies/babies1.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <p>Parent room is not simply a room with a bed, but a room meeting diverse needs of mothers, supporting perfect basic infrastructure and guaranteed service. At the same time ,develop management system, clear responsibilities, improve service, avoid to be a white elephant, so that mothers have the dignity, safety and reassurance to exercise their mothers' rights.</p>\n                <h1>PROBLEMS IN CHINA</h1>\n                <p>The institution Babytree in China has made an investigation of one hundred and fifty thousand family  about the parent room, the result shows that only 11.3% of the company provides nursery rooms for mothers. And the higher level the city is, the better situation it gets.</p>\n                <p>At present, not private and incomplete internal hardware facilities become the main  problems of most parent rooms in China. Also, the majority of parent rooms are poor in sanitary conditions ,not comfortable, even everybody can enter, and the area is too small. </p>\n                <p>The survey also collected the needs of mothers for the location of the nursery. 63.5% mothers were most expected to set up public parent rooms in the mall, Then the park and the street with 54.9%  and 39.6% .</p>\n                <img src=\"images/babies/babies2.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <p>As a result, there is still a lot of room for development and improvement of parent room inChina , and there is a growing demand of it. So I chose this theme, and want to offer a possible solution to improve this situation.</p>\n                <h1>RESEARCH</h1>\n                <p>These were three shopping malls I chose, which are the center of children shopping as well as having nursery rooms.

The most common used services in gallery are introduction next to the exhibits, manual tour guide and brochures. Only two of them understood every painting. One person did not understand paintings completely. There are 42 people who want to know about the artist's background and 39 people who want to experience the scenes.</p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/6.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>USER REQUAIREMENT</h1>\n                <p>1.Have less people in gallery, so that user can concentrate on the paintings I like.</p>\n                <p>2.User want to buy souvenirs so that the memory of visiting the gallery can be saved.</p>\n                <p>3.Feel the emotion that the artist have, so that user can understand the paintings deeply.</p>\n                <p>4.Have a comfortable environment so that user can have passion to explore.</p>\n                <p>And these are the reasons that I chose VR to develop this project.</p>\n                <h1>DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h1>\n                <p>It’s always a tough task for me - a curious person without professional art knowledge - to understand paintings, especially in a museum or a gallery. White space, quiet environment and far distance, they all make me feel far away from artworks.</p>\n                <p>So I was thinking, why can’t we experience the artist’s pieces as well his emotion directly, so that we can immerse and understand more.</p>\n                <p>The project was designed to allow people understanding more about the famous masters’ painting through VR interaction. We chose Van Gogh’s last painting in life ——“Wheatfield with Crows”as an example, reverted  the painting”Van Gogh's bedroom” to VR scene, added another room and some items .The background period is 1889 - 1990 when Van Gogh’s reached the peak so that users can be immersive, as if burst into the painter's life, get a glimpse of his emotion, at the same time  pay tribute to the great painters like Van Gogh and so on.</p>\n                <h1>TOPIC &amp; BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/7.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>\n                <h2>Art</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>During the art process, we read the biographical novel \"yearn for life”, searched for information about Van Gogh, and reverted the story into the art scheme.

At the same time, we imported 3d model into Unity, added animation and collider and so on. After 3 nights that stay up late, we completed the programming part. Also, we finished the opening cinematic with Animation in Maya.<br>\n                <em>Software: Unity, Steam VR, Autodesk Maya 2016</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/10.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h2>User Test</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>At the end of the project, we invited some teachers and students in CDM to do some user tests. In the process, we told them what they need to accomplish and observed their behavior. Then we asked some prepared relevant questions to them. According to their feedback, we improved interactive logic and enriched some details, including opening cinematic and the story line.<br>\n                <em>Software: Steam VR</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/11.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>\n                <div class=\"video-wrap\">\n                    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0CyFXlAPnI\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/12.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/13.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/14.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                `.trim()\n                break;\n\n            case 5:\n                sub_page_html = `\n                    <h1 class=\"title\">Wanderline</h1>\n                    <h6 class=\"desc\">DEC.2016 -- JAN.2017 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                    <hr>\n                    <p>Nowadays, highly developed network has made it much easier to communicate with all parts of the world.

I used RPG Maker to develop this game.</p>\n                \n                <h3>Game Screenshots</h3>\n                <img src=\"images/games/gamec1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/games/gamec2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/games/gamec3.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/games/gamec4.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h3>Game Design</h3>\n                <img src=\"images/games/gamec5.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n                `.trim()\n                break;\n        \n            default:\n                sub_page_html = 'No Project Content!'\n                break;\n        }\n\n        showSubPage(sub_page_html)\n    })\n\n    /**\n     * Show arts sub page\n     */\n    $('#art_works_show').on('click', '.inner', (e)=>{\n        var section = $(e.currentTarget),\n        no = section.data('no'),\n        sub_page_html = '';\n\n        switch (no) {\n            case 1:\n                sub_page_html = `\n                <h1 class=\"title\">CERAMICS</h1>\n                <h6 class=\"desc\">JUL. 2017</h6>\n                <hr>\n                <p>Last summer, I went to UCLA to have summer session classes.

In the field of third-party payment on mobile phones, Alipay and WeChat Pay take the lead in China. However, Alipay on Apple Watch is only applicable to recieve notifications after the transfer, which makes the user experience relative poor. WeChat Pay even doesn’t provide payment feature on Apple Watch. Since mobile phones are not as convenient as watches in certain circumstances, Easily Pay makes it possible for users to pay through watches when they are jogging, or going for walks. We hope that people can unfettered by mobile phones in payment situations.</p>\n                <img src=\"images/arts/pay/1.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>APP DIAGRAM</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/arts/pay/2.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>PRODUCT FUNCTION</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/arts/pay/3.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>UI DESIGN</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/arts/pay/4.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>USAGE SCENARIO</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/arts/pay/5.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                `.trim()\n                break;\n        \n            default:\n                sub_page_html = 'No Project Content!'\n                break;\n        }\n\n        showSubPage(sub_page_html)\n    })\n\n    /**\n     * Highlight navigation tab\n     */\n    function HighlightNav(opts){\n        this.limit_line = _win_height / 2;\n\n        this.base_areas = $('.hl-base-area');\n\n        this.nearest_area = {\n            distance: 0,\n            class: null\n        };\n    }\n\n    HighlightNav.prototype.onScroll = function(){\n        var _me = this;\n\n        _me.base_areas.each((i, e)=>{\n            // console.log(_me.nearest_area)\n\n            var _top = getBCR(e, 'top'),\n                _target_nav_class = $(e).data('hl-target'),\n                _target_nav = $('.'+_target_nav_class);\n\n            if(_top > _me.limit_line){\n                // remove highlight from nav\n                _target_nav.hasClass('active') && _target_nav.removeClass('active');\n                if(_me.nearest_area.class == _target_nav_class){\n                    _me.nearest_area.class = null;\n                }\n            }else{\n                var _dis = Math.abs(_top - _me.limit_line);\n\n                if(_me.nearest_area.class === null){\n                    _me.nearest_area.class = _target_nav_class;\n                    _me.nearest_area.distance = _dis;\n                }else if(_me.nearest_area.class == _target_nav_class){\n                    _me.nearest_area.distance = _dis;\n                }else if(_dis < _me.nearest_area.distance){\n                    $('.'+_me.nearest_area.class).removeClass('active');\n                    _me.nearest_area.class = _target_nav_class;\n                    _me.nearest_area.distance = _dis;\n                }\n            }\n        })\n\n        $('.'+_me.nearest_area.class).addClass('active');\n    }\n\n    var highlight_nav = new HighlightNav();\n\n    _win.scroll(function(e){\n        highlight_nav.onScroll();\n    }).trigger('scroll')\n\n\n    /**************      Tool     **************/\n    function getBCR(ele, type) {\n        if (type !== undefined) {\n        return ele.getBoundingClientRect()[type];\n        } else {\n        return ele.getBoundingClientRect();\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Preload\n     */\n    // function init() {\n    //     var indexID = 0,\n    //         pre_files = [],\n    //         loader = new createjs.LoadQueue();\n\n    //     // add preload images\n    //     $('body').find('img').each(function (i, e) {\n    //         pre_files.push({\n    //             \"id\": \"img\" + indexID++,\n    //             \"src\": $(e).attr('src')\n    //         });\n    //     });\n\n    //     loader.addEventListener(\"complete\", handleComplete);\n    //     loader.addEventListener('progress', handleProgress);\n    //     loader.addEventListener('error', handleError);\n\n    //     // Start loading\n    //     loader.loadManifest(pre_files);\n\n    //     function handleComplete() {\n    //         // console.log('Loading complete...');\n    //         resizeAll();\n\n    //         init_funcs.forEach((e) => {\n    //             e();\n    //         });\n\n    //     }\n\n    //     function handleProgress(e) {\n    //         var num = Math.floor(e.progress * 100);\n    //         console.log(num);\n    //     }\n\n    //     function handleError(e) {\n    //         console.error(e.title);\n    //         console.dir(e.data);\n    //     }\n\n    // }\n    // init();\n\n}(jQuery, window));"]}
