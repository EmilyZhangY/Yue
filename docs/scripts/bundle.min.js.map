At the same time ,develop management system, clear responsibilities, improve service, avoid to be a white elephant, so that mothers have the dignity, safety and reassurance to exercise their mothers' rights.</p>\n                <h1>PROBLEMS IN CHINA</h1>\n                <p>The institution Babytree in China has made an investigation of one hundred and fifty thousand family  about the parent room, the result shows that only 11.3% of the company provides nursery rooms for mothers. And the higher level the city is, the better situation it gets.</p>\n                <p>At present, not private and incomplete internal hardware facilities become the main  problems of most parent rooms in China. Also, the majority of parent rooms are poor in sanitary conditions ,not comfortable, even everybody can enter, and the area is too small. </p>\n                <p>The survey also collected the needs of mothers for the location of the nursery. 63.5% mothers were most expected to set up public parent rooms in the mall, Then the park and the street with 54.9%  and 39.6% .</p>\n                <img src=\"images/babies/babies2.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <p>As a result, there is still a lot of room for development and improvement of parent room inChina , and there is a growing demand of it. So I chose this theme, and want to offer a possible solution to improve this situation.</p>\n                <h1>RESEARCH</h1>\n                <p>These were three shopping malls I chose, which are the center of children shopping as well as having nursery rooms. I found some reviews about the nursery rooms on the internet.

The most common used services in gallery are introduction next to the exhibits, manual tour guide and brochures. Only two of them understood every painting. One person did not understand paintings completely. There are 42 people who want to know about the artist's background and 39 people who want to experience the scenes.</p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/6.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>USER REQUAIREMENT</h1>\n                <p>1.Have less people in gallery, so that user can concentrate on the paintings I like.</p>\n                <p>2.User want to buy souvenirs so that the memory of visiting the gallery can be saved.</p>\n                <p>3.Feel the emotion that the artist have, so that user can understand the paintings deeply.</p>\n                <p>4.Have a comfortable environment so that user can have passion to explore.</p>\n                <p>And these are the reasons that I chose VR to develop this project.</p>\n                <h1>DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h1>\n                <p>It’s always a tough task for me - a curious person without professional art knowledge - to understand paintings, especially in a museum or a gallery. White space, quiet environment and far distance, they all make me feel far away from artworks.</p>\n                <p>So I was thinking, why can’t we experience the artist’s pieces as well his emotion directly, so that we can immerse and understand more.</p>\n                <p>The project was designed to allow people understanding more about the famous masters’ painting through VR interaction. We chose Van Gogh’s last painting in life ——“Wheatfield with Crows”as an example, reverted  the painting”Van Gogh's bedroom” to VR scene, added another room and some items .The background period is 1889 - 1990 when Van Gogh’s reached the peak so that users can be immersive, as if burst into the painter's life, get a glimpse of his emotion, at the same time  pay tribute to the great painters like Van Gogh and so on.</p>\n                <h1>TOPIC &amp; BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h1>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/7.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>\n                <h2>Art</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>During the art process, we read the biographical novel \"yearn for life”, searched for information about Van Gogh, and reverted the story into the art scheme.  After that, we designed the furniture and decoration of the painting room and bedroom, chose artistic style of retro and colorful and drew the scenes, room arrangement and texture.<br> \n                <em>Software: Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/8.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h2>3D Modeling </h2>\n                <h3>Time: 5 Days</h3>\n                <p>In this VR project, every element needed to be 3d model.

Some of these models need to be separated into different parts, so that user can interact with and play around.<br> \n                <em>Software: Autodesk Maya 2016, Photoshop CC 2015</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/9.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h2>Programming</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 4 Days</h3>\n                <p>We hadn’t learned how to write codes for VR projects before, so we searched the open source code using Javascript, studied and restructured it with the help of teacher. At the same time, we imported 3d model into Unity, added animation and collider and so on. After 3 nights that stay up late, we completed the programming part. Also, we finished the opening cinematic with Animation in Maya.<br>\n                <em>Software: Unity, Steam VR, Autodesk Maya 2016</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/10.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h2>User Test</h2>\n                <h3>Time: 2 Days</h3>\n                <p>At the end of the project, we invited some teachers and students in CDM to do some user tests. In the process, we told them what they need to accomplish and observed their behavior. Then we asked some prepared relevant questions to them. According to their feedback, we improved interactive logic and enriched some details, including opening cinematic and the story line.<br>\n                <em>Software: Steam VR</em><br>\n                <em>Hardware: HTC Vive</em></p>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/11.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>\n                <div class=\"video-wrap\">\n                    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0CyFXlAPnI\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/12.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/13.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                <img src=\"images/finalpiece/14.png\" alt=\"Image\">\n                `.trim()\n                break;\n\n            case 5:\n                sub_page_html = `\n                    <h1 class=\"title\">PROJRECT 5</h1>\n                    <h6 class=\"desc\">JULY 2016 -- AUGUST 2016 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                    <hr>\n                    <h1>TITLE 1</h1>\n                    <h2>Title 2</h2>\n                    <h3>Title 3</h3>\n                    <p>texte xttextt exte xttextte xtextte xttexte xttex ttexte xttextt extextte xttex text text</p>\n                    <img src=\"images/test-img.jpg\" alt=\"Test Image\">\n                    <div class=\"video-wrap\">\n                        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ekUyxxpBt0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>Loading...</iframe>\n                    </div>\n                `.trim()\n                break;\n        \n            default:\n                sub_page_html = 'No Project Content!'\n                break;\n        }\n\n        showSubPage(sub_page_html)\n    })\n\n    /**\n     * Show game sub page\n     */\n    $('#games_show').on('click', '.game', (e)=>{\n        var section = $(e.currentTarget),\n        no = section.data('no'),\n        sub_page_html = '';\n\n        switch (no) {\n            case 1:\n                sub_page_html = `\n                <h1 class=\"title\">Harmonic on the Ocean</h1>\n                <h6 class=\"desc\">DEC. 2016 -- JAN. 2017 / PERSONAL PROJECT</h6>\n                <hr>\n                <p>This is my final project of the European and American Children Picture Books class in the exchanging semester in Taiwan.
